A comprehensive sales analysis dashboard built with Microsoft Power BI. This project demonstrates an end-to-end business intelligence workflow, from data modeling and transformation to creating insightful and interactive visualizations. The dashboard is designed to provide stakeholders at "Crux Cycles" with a clear overview of sales performance across different dimensions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Methodology

This project demonstrates a complete business intelligence pipeline within the Power BI ecosystem.

- **Data Modeling (Star Schema):**

  - The data model is built on a **star schema**, a best practice for performance and clarity in Power BI.
  - It consists of one central fact table (`FactInternetSales`) and multiple dimension tables (`DimDate`, `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`, etc.).
  - Relationships are carefully managed to ensure correct filter propagation from dimensions to the fact table.

- **Data Transformation (Power Query / M Language):**

  - Raw data sources (CSVs) are connected and transformed using Power Query.
  - Steps include cleaning data, handling missing values, changing data types, and merging queries to create the final tables for the model.

- **Business Logic (DAX):**

  - Complex business calculations are handled using **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)**. Key measures created for this report include:
    - `Total Sales`
    - `No of Orders` & `No of Customer`
    - `Sales YTD` (Year-to-Date)
    - `Sales (PY)` (Prior Year Sales)
    - `YoY Growth %` (Year-over-Year Growth Percentage)

- **Report Design & Visualization:**
  - The report is designed with a focus on **user experience (UX)**, using a consistent color theme, clear titles, and logical placement of visuals.
  - Custom branding, including a logo and icons, is used to create a professional and polished final product.

## üíª Running the Project Locally

To explore this project on your own machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    - Download and install **[Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/)** (it's free).

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MuhammadTahir-1-9-4/Crux-Cycles-Sales-Dashboard.git
    cd Crux-Cycles-Sales-Dashboard
    ```

3.  **Open the file:**

    - Navigate to the project directory and open the **`Crux_Cycles_Sales_Analysis.pbix`** file with Power BI Desktop.

4.  **Update Data Source Paths (If Necessary):**
    - Since the original data sources are local, Power BI may show an error.
    - Go to **Transform data** ‚Üí **Data source settings**.
    - For each data source, select it, click **Change Source...**, and browse to the location of the data files on your machine.

## üìà Future Improvements

- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Implement RLS to restrict data visibility for different user roles (e.g., a European Sales Manager can only see European data).
- **Performance Optimization:** Analyze query performance using DAX Studio and optimize complex measures to ensure the report remains fast and responsive.
- **"What-If" Analysis:** Add a page with "What-if" parameters to allow users to forecast sales based on different assumptions (e.g., a 10% increase in bike sales).
